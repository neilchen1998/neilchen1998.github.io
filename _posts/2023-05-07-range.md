# A Brief Introduction to Ranges

## What is a range?
A range is an object that you can iterate over. It is represented by an iterator that marks the beginning of the range and a sentinel that denotes the end of the range. Before C++ 20, we need to use *vec.begin()* and *vec.end()* to denote the vector. However, we can use *std::ranges* to help us do that and make it less error-prone. In this post, there are two examples that can shorten the code by utilizing the range library in C++ 20.

## An Example
Say our goal is to extract odd numbers from a given vector, multiply the odd numbers by 3, and print out the result. Firstly, We need to define two helper functions: one that returns true if the input number is odd and the other multiplies the input number by 3. Secondly, we need to create an output vector that stores the result. Thirdly, we copy the elements from the original vector only when the elements are odd. Finally, we use multiply each element by 3. The following block of code is the implementation before C++ 20.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    // the original vector
    const std::vector vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

    // a function that return true if the input number is odd
    auto odd = [](const int i){ return i % 2; };

    // a function that multiplies the input by 3
    auto triple = [](const int i){ return 3 * i; };

    // before C++ 20 we need to create an output vector
    std::vector<int> output;
    std::copy_if(vec.begin(), vec.end(), std::back_inserter(output), odd);

    // and use std::transform to multiply each element by 3
    std::transform(output.begin(), output.end(), output.begin(), triple);

    // print out the vector
    for (const int& v : output)
        std::cout << v << " ";

    return 0;
}
```

We need three lines of code to achieve our goal. Letâ€™s switch gear to C++ 20 and see how many lines of code do we need. First, we define two helper functions like we did. Then we filter the original vector and multiply the result by using *std::views::filter* and *std::views::transform* in a single line. And thatâ€™s it, the output is a type of range which is called view and we can print out the elements of it directly without the need of an itermediate vector.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <ranges>

int main()
{
    // the original vector
    const std::vector vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

    // a function that return true if the input number is odd
    auto odd = [](const int i){ return i % 2; };

    // a function that multiplies the input by 3
    auto triple = [](const int i){ return 3 * i; };

    // a new way to do the aforementioned operation in C++ 20 is using std::view
    auto output = vec
        | std::views::filter(odd)
        | std::views::transform(triple);

    for (const int& v : output)
        cout << v << " ";

    return 0;
}
```

The pipe ($\vert$) symbol chains the operations together and is read from left to right.

## Summary
In this post, we learn that we can achieve the goal by using the ranges library. The operation is cleaner and can be understood by others easily without the need of an itermediate container.

Happy coding ðŸ˜€
