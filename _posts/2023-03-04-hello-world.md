# Welcome

Welcome to my homepage, there is nothing here at the moment.
However, there will be more posts coming.
I will be sharing what I learn, my thoughts, and more.

So, please come back often!

## My Very First Post

I always want to have a blog to post some articles so I can share with others.
And now I finally found a solution.

## Code

Knowing how to use a code block will come handy in the future.

```bash
echo hello
```

Happy coding ðŸ˜€
